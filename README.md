# Project Overview
ðŸŽ¯ This project's aim is to identify high-confidence germline INDEL and SNPs variant calls, following GATK best practices for human whole-genome data.

- The dataset consists of human WGS paired-end Illumina reads (2Ã—100 bp) from the 1000 Genomes Project (sample ID: HG00096), sequenced at ~30Ã— coverage.
- Two paired-end FASTQ files were downloaded for the sample HG00096:
  - SRR062634_1.filt.fastq.gz
  - SRR062634_2.filt.fastq.gz
- The reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with a read length of 100 bp. The estimated mean coverage is 30Ã— across the genome.

Reads were aligned to the GRCh38/hg38 reference genome using BWA-MEM, followed by sorting, duplicate marking, and known variant resources from GATKâ€™s hg38 bundle (dbSNP build 138) were used for base recalibration and variant annotation. Variants were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller and filtered based on standard hard-filtering parameters. The resulting SNPs and indels were evaluated using bcftools statistics and annotated with Ensembl VEP to assess potential functional consequences.

~3.5 M variants were identified; most were intergenic, with a few near mitochondrial genes.

  <em>The insert size distribution for SRR062634_sorted_dedup_bqsr_reads.bam shows a single peak around ~180 bp with a narrow standard deviation, indicating consistent library preparation and proper fragment length. No secondary peaks or abnormal broadening were observed.</em>

## Variant Calling Matrics
| Metric                             | Result    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| Total raw variants                 | 1,091,729 |
| Number of samples |1|
| Number of High-Quality SNPs         | 1,384     |
| number of multiallelic sites  | 27 |
| number of multiallelic SNP sites | 11 |
| Transition-to-Transversion ratio | 1.80 |
| Indels NUmber of high-quality indels  | 967  |

<details>
  
  - *multiallelic site A genomic position with more than one alternate allele, regardless of type (SNP, indel, etc.). Example REF = A; ALT = C,CG*
  - *Multiallelic SNP site - Specifically, a multiallelic site where all alternates are SNPs (single base substitutions). Example REF = A; ALT = C,G*
  - *Transitions = Aâ†”G or Câ†”T (changes between similar base types: purineâ†”purine or pyrimidineâ†”pyrimidine). Transversions = Aâ†”C, Aâ†”T, Gâ†”C, or Gâ†”T (purineâ†”pyrimidine).*
  - *Transition-to-Transversion ratio(ts/tv) Ratio of transitions to transversions. Only Snps have ts/tv trations*

</details>

**The Ts/Tv ratio = 1.08, which is lower than expected for high-quality human data.**
  
    Typically:
    - ~2.0â€“3.0 for high-quality germline calls.
    - ~1.0â€“1.2 for low-quality or somatic calls, or poorly filtered data.
    
    So this might mean:
    - The dataset has some false positives.
      - A false positive means the variant caller called a position as a variant, but in reality, itâ€™s not a true biological change. 
      - Itâ€™s usually due to: 
        - Sequencing errors (e.g., low-quality bases or reads), 
        - Misalignment (reads mapped to the wrong region), 
        - Poor filtering (keeping low-quality calls).
    - Or, itâ€™s not human (some non-model organism).
    - Or, youâ€™re still before final filtering, but we have done filtering

# Discussion/Conclusion

The majority of high-confidence variants were non-coding, suggesting no direct impact on protein structure. However, several upstream variants were detected in mitochondrial genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (MT-ND1, MT-ND2). While likely benign, regulatory effects cannot be ruled out without functional validation.

This small project demonstrates the variant calling workflow, particularly around data preprocessing and variant quality filtration. Future improvements could include integrating automated annotation (Funcotator/SnpEff), building a Jupyter report for summary statistics, and containerizing the entire workflow with Docker or Nextflow.
